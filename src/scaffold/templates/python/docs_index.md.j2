## Quick Start

Create a new project with scaffold:

```bash
sc init {{ project_name }}
```

This will:

1. Create the project structure
2. Install dependencies with `uv sync`
3. Install git hooks with `prek install`
4. Run `pytest` to verify everything works
5. Show "Ready to code!" when complete

Then just:

```bash
cd {{ project_name }}
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install {{ project_name }}
```

## Usage

### As a library

```python
from {{ package_name }}.core import example_function

result = example_function("World")
print(result)  # Hello, World!
```

### As a CLI

```bash
{{ package_name }} hello World
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## AI Integration

### MCP Server

This project includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AI-powered documentation access.

**Setup with Claude Code:**

```bash
# Install MCP dependencies
uv sync --extra mcp

# Add MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add {{ package_name }} --transport stdio uv run --with mcp python src/{{ package_name }}/mcp_server.py
```

### Agent Skill

A Claude Code Agent Skill is included in `.skills/{{ package_name }}/SKILL.md`.

**Install the skill:**

```bash
# From project root
claude skill add .skills/{{ package_name }}
```

The skill helps Claude understand and work with this project more effectively.
